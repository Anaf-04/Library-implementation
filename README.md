# Library-implementation
A simple library where you can add a book, delete a book, view the current number of books, and sort it. This library can store up to 10 books, and each must have a unique ID. When you want to add a book, it asks for a unique ID and date. After adding a book, you can view it by inputting 2, which shows all the books in the library. You can also delete a book, and it asks for the ID of that book. You can sort the number of books by ID or date. When you select ID, it shows the books in ascending order of IDs. When you choose the date, it displays the books chronologically from the past to the present. When the date matches another book, it sorts the books according to ID.
